# Machine-Learning---Dota-2-Prediction
Logistic regression to predict chances of winning using R

Predictors used:  
First analysis: team composition  
Second analysis: gold and xp

Results:  
team composition advantage is not correlated with outcomes. the advantage could be calculated using a different method.  
gold and xp are positively correlated with winning. the model accurately predicted 73.7% of the outcomes of games in the test data set. There was a high probability of winning at around 2000 gold and 2000 XP (experience) points advantage.
